## Overview

![Overview image of test setup](media/overview.png)

Lidl sells batteries for their Parkside-branded power tools. These are 5S lithium-ion batteries that are well-constructed and cost approximately â‚¬20 for the 4 Ah version. While the cells are not from premium brands, they appear to be of relatively high quality. For instance, the 4 Ah battery I purchased contains Sunpower INR19/66 cells. Detailed information about these cells can be found here:

Currently, Lidl offers a USB charger add-on for these batteries, but it has significant limitations. Its output power is restricted to 15 W, and it does not support charging the battery via USB.

The adaptor described here comprises a 3D-printed enclosure and a PCB with soldered contacts that connect to the battery terminals. The interface PCB includes two mounting locations for power modules.

The bi-directional 100 W USB-C module, based on the IP2368 chip, is used in the current implementation.

Future developments are planned, including a 240 W power module and a PCB with a microcontroller and control logic.

## IP2368

The IP2368 chip is available in several firmware versions. I chose the IP2368_I2C_NACT variant, which supports I2C communication and can function as a USB-C source immediately upon connection to a battery, without requiring an initial connection to a charger. Sourcing this chip outside China is challenging; I obtained mine via [LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/Power-Management-Specialized_INJOINIC-IP2368_I2C_COUT_C5372184.html). Note that a quotation request is necessary, as this chip is typically not in stock.
